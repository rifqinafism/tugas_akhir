In this research, we designed IoT-based power management system, control and communication system, and waste capacity warning system of a trash skimmer. The prototype could collect 6.4 kg or 0.016 m3 of waste for each operation. Position of the trash skimmer, power usage, and the waste capacity of the trash skimmer can be seen in real-time through Grafana dashboard API.

The trash skimmer monitoring system consists of power monitoring, warning system for waste capacity, and position monitoring. Figure bellow shows the appearance of the trash skimmer monitoring system using the Grafana Dashboard API. The program interface consists of the latest location tracking using the NEO-6M GPS module, waste capacity warning system using ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04, and power monitoring system using voltage sensor.
