In this research, we designed IoT-based power management system, control and communication system, and waste capacity warning system of a trash skimmer. The prototype could collect 6.4 kg or 0.016 m3 of waste for each operation. Position of the trash skimmer, power usage, and the waste capacity of the trash skimmer can be seen in real-time through Grafana dashboard API.
